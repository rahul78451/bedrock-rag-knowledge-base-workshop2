### Rag Query: A Knowledge Retrieval Project 🤖
> "Empowering Knowledge Retrieval with AI-Driven Insights" 💡

📖 Description
---------------
Rag Query is an innovative Python project that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base. The project utilizes the Bedrock Agent Runtime client to interact with a knowledge base and retrieve answers to user-submitted questions. With its robust architecture and intuitive design, Rag Query aims to revolutionize the way we access and utilize knowledge.

The project's core functionality revolves around the `ask_question` function, which takes a user-input question as a parameter and returns a relevant answer from the knowledge base. This is achieved through the integration of the Bedrock Agent Runtime client, which provides a seamless interface for interacting with the knowledge base. The project also incorporates a machine learning model, specifically the Anthropic Claude-3-Sonnet model, to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the retrieved answers.

One of the key benefits of Rag Query is its ability to provide users with accurate and up-to-date information, leveraging the collective knowledge of the knowledge base. The project's architecture is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for easy integration with various knowledge bases and machine learning models. Whether you're a researcher, student, or simply a curious individual, Rag Query is an invaluable tool for uncovering new insights and expanding your knowledge.
